 https://camp-fire.jp/projects/view/648742

 ,and many people make homebrew or doujin game/app with this feature.
 To use MSX0 with fMSX3DS, Choose "[Option]" item in the fMSX3DS system menu, and enable the "Use MSX0" option item.

 fMSX3DS use fake MSXIOT ROM file for MSX0 and you need no MSXIOT ROM file.
 But, some MSX0 games/apps requires MSX-BASIC KUN(X-BASIC) ROM.
 If you are using BlueMSX core for retroarch, fMSX3DS load it's ROM files directly and no need for setup X-BASIC ROM files.
 If not, Rename MSX-BASIC KUN PLUS(X-BASIC2) ROM to "MSX0_XBASIC.ROM" or "XBASIC2.rom" and copy that to the ROOT of your SD card
 or "FMSX3DS" folder("root\FMSX3DS").

-Add support for MSXTurboR!
 Good news for New3DS user. I tested many MSXTurboR games/ apps and all of them works full speed at 60fps on New3DS.
 And bad news for Old3DS user. Most of MSXTurboR games/apps runs slowly on Old3DS.
 It can't be helped because MSXTurboR has over x8 faster CPU than MSX2+.
 But, silver lining is that many enhanced patched game work better with MSXTurboR and most of these games works full speed even on Old3DS.
 
 You need MSXTurboR BIOS files to run MSXTurboR.
 If you are using BlueMSX core for retroarch, fMSX3DS load it's BIOS files directly and no need for setup BIOS files.
